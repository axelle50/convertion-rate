### Objective
We organized a Supervised machine learning challenge for our promotion students. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning algorithm in order to predict the conversion rate on a website. Conversion rate i.e. "will the customer buy a product or not?".  
- Try different algorithms
- Train the best algorithm on all data
- Deliver predictions on a test set

## Dataset
Dataset from Jedha: [train set](https://julie-2-next-resources.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/full-stack-full-time/projects-supervised-machine-learning-ft/walmart-sales-ft/conversion_data_train.csv) and [test set](https://julie-2-next-resources.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/full-stack-full-time/projects-supervised-machine-learning-ft/walmart-sales-ft/conversion_data_test.csv)

## Prerequisites
Download and extract both datasets from the links above

### Dependencies
- The source code is written in Python 3.
- The python packages can be installed with pip : `pip3 install -R requirements.txt`

## Usage
### Run the file linearly
